# 🍽️ Interactive Console Menu - Java

This little project is a practice exercise in Java that demonstrates how to create an interactive menu using control structures like `do-while`, `switch`, and conditionals. A perfect way to reinforce logic and get comfortable building small console programs. 💻

## 📚 What I practiced here

- Using `Scanner` for user input
- Applying `do-while` and `switch` control structures
- Organizing basic Java code
- Cleaning and presenting output in the console

## 🚀 How to run it

1. Make sure Java is installed (`java -version`)
2. Compile the file:

```bash
java MenuInteractivo


===== MAIN MENU =====
1. Option 1
2. Option 2
3. Option 3
0. Exit
======================
